&lt;p&gt;By the shore, I wash my feet,&lt;br&gt;
As night’s shadows with currents meet.&lt;br&gt;
In morning light, my short hair dries,&lt;br&gt;
With gentle breezes whispering sighs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Through Wu’s mountains and Chu’s lakes I roam,&lt;br&gt;
Yet long for Xiang, my heart’s true home.&lt;br&gt;
I buy a boat, my cares I leave,&lt;br&gt;
Returning from office, free to believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Heaven’s favor guides my way,&lt;br&gt;
In June’s warm embrace, I’ll drift and sway,&lt;br&gt;
With fair winds lifting me on the tide,&lt;br&gt;
Floating through waves, I take my stride.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Lofty thoughts, like cicadas shed their shell,&lt;br&gt;
Soaring above the dust.&lt;br&gt;
Like Zhuangzi dreaming of butterfly flight,&lt;br&gt;
I wander where waters and clouds unite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Faintly I envision—garments of lotus green,&lt;br&gt;
Adorned with autumn orchids, a grace serene,&lt;br&gt;
Attired in elegance, shedding earthly bind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The goddess of Xiang with a charming smile,&lt;br&gt;
Dances in robes, graceful all the while.&lt;br&gt;
Her delicate fingers pluck strings with care,&lt;br&gt;
Releasing a haunting tune into the air.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Awakening Qu Yuan’s loyal pain,&lt;br&gt;
In &amp;ldquo;Nine Songs&amp;rdquo;, his vows remain.&lt;br&gt;
Words that shine, like sun and moon,&lt;br&gt;
Flow from his sleeve, a timeless tune.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Oh, let not the children know this delight,&lt;br&gt;
The river’s dreams are ours to write.&lt;br&gt;
For this joy in rowing, vast and grand,&lt;br&gt;
Is a treasure meant for our own hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upper poem is the translated version of a poem from the Song Dynasty by Zhang Xiaoxiang.It is the work of Zhang Xiaoxiang when he was boating on the Xiangjiang River on the way back to the north. The original poem is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;濯足夜滩急，晞发北风凉。吴山楚泽行遍，只欠到潇湘。买得扁舟归去，此事天公付我，六月下沧浪。蝉蜕尘埃外，蝶梦水云乡。&lt;br&gt;制荷衣，纫兰佩，把琼芳。湘妃起舞一笑，抚瑟奏清商。唤起九歌忠愤，拂拭三闾文字，还与日争光。莫遣儿辈觉，此乐未渠央。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, our school organized a study trip to Hunan, spanning five days. During this time, we traveled between Changsha and Shaoshan, exploring both rural and urban landscapes, witnessing the fusion and collision of traditional culture and modern society, strolling by the lakes and rivers, and contemplating the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-1-setting-off&#34;&gt;Day 1: Setting Off!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Midday, the entire grade, teachers, and staff gathered at Shenzhen North Railway Station, to board the high-speed train bound for Changsha. Arriving at noon, the weather was surprisingly mild, a rare treat in the South.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an hour’s wait, we finally boarded the sleek Fuxing Electric Multiple Unit. Its modern design and technology showcased our school’s commitment to student comfort and efficiency. Riding the high-speed rail instead of the slower options not only enhanced our travel experience, but also reflected our nation’s advancements in transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dongli.pages.dev/file/e41e2239142abfb175247.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;复兴号&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before boarding, I snapped a few photos of the train as I walked along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scenery outside the window, from the alluvial plains of the Pearl River Delta to the karst landscapes of northern Guangdong, and the hills and plains of both southern and northern Hunan, was all breathtaking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approaching Guangzhou, rain began to fall, adding a touch of Jiangnan charm to our journey as we glimpsed barges on distant rivers under misty skies.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we made stops at Shaoguan, Chenzhou, and Hengyang before arriving at Changsha South Station, a journey of approximately three and a half hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dongli.pages.dev/file/090ef6ec71df637ea0906.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;长沙南站附近的公路&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, we boarded a bus near Changsha South Station. I was fortunate to sit in the front row, offering one of the best views. After a meal and a nighttime cruise on the Liuyang River, we stayed overnight at a hotel near Huanghua Airport, concluding our first day’s journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-2-blending-old-with-new&#34;&gt;Day 2: Blending Old with New
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning to downtown Changsha, we began the day with a visit to the Hunan Provincial Museum, renowned for its artifacts excavated from the Han Dynasty tombs at Mawangdui. On the third floor, we watched a captivating light show played every half hour on the tomb’s sidewalls. Shadows danced on walls over ten meters deep, bringing to life ancient clothing and auspicious patterns, evoking a sense of reverence and mystery akin to a religious experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dongli.pages.dev/file/650e1f5638bdcd4491cd8.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture below is a picture of the grave pit before the performance. You can refer to the people in the stands and estimate the depth of the triangle with the relevant knowledge of the triangle that you learned in junior high.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;墓坑&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, we crossed the Xiang River to visit Hunan University, Yuelu Academy, and Aiwan Pavilion. Known as a &amp;ldquo;millennium-old academy,&amp;rdquo; Hunan University exudes a strong academic atmosphere amidst serene surroundings. At the entrance, university students dressed in traditional attire added youthful vigor to the campus.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://dongli.pages.dev/file/dcb3f561ce97af139d5c7.jpg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;湖南大学的一栋建筑&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we explored Yuelu Academy. Towering ancient trees and flowing waters adorned the site, where every stone inscription and historic building reflected the deep cultural heritage of Hunan. Amidst these ancient halls, we connected with the wisdom of past scholars, experiencing firsthand the cultural richness encapsulated in the phrase, &amp;ldquo;Only Chu produces talent, and here it reaches its peak(惟楚有材，于斯为盛)&amp;rdquo;.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://dongli.pages.dev/file/dab50c233fc26466d37d7.jpg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;惟楚有材，于斯为盛&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing north from the academy towards Aiwan Pavilion, we encountered Tang Bohu’s poetic sentiment. Despite it is now the modern era, it was difficult not to imagine Tang Bohu’s leisurely mood at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I paint the azure Yangtze’s flow,&lt;br&gt;Maple leaves at Aiwan Pavilion woe.&lt;br&gt;Autumn moon gently bathes the Buddhist shrine,&lt;br&gt;Incense smoke curls around the scripture hall divine.&lt;br&gt;(我画蓝江水悠悠，爱晚亭上枫叶愁。秋月溶溶照佛寺，香烟袅袅绕经楼。)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dongli.pages.dev/file/499cea4a396e002b78089.jpg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;爱晚亭&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then returned along the same route to visit Taiping Old Street for field research (actually, it was shopping). Despite being touted as &amp;ldquo;the street with the most intact original street pattern of ancient Changsha,&amp;rdquo; it unfortunately fell short of preserving its cultural essence, appearing somewhat homogeneous and commercialized. Adjacent sites, such as Jia Yi’s former residence, seemed out of place.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://dongli.pages.dev/file/dc6b915c65fc9d3cf50ab.jpg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;太平老街&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Taiping Old Street’s &amp;ldquo;Black Classic&amp;rdquo; stinky tofu was indeed delicious and reasonably priced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During free time on Taiping Old Street, I experienced Changsha’s metro system. The stations resembled those in Shenzhen, but amenities inside the Shenzhen metro trains, such as display screens, announcements, and station cleanliness, surpassed those in Changsha’s metro.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-3-embracing-tradition&#34;&gt;Day 3: Embracing Tradition
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Changsha to Shaoshan, our journey took about three hours, arriving at the research and practice base in Huangtian Village, where we met local farmers and engaged in activities such as fishing in rice fields and transplanting seedlings, followed by a meal at a farmhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huangtian Village’s picturesque surroundings included roadside encounters with some unnamed wildflowers.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://dongli.pages.dev/file/2f0463b6f5d91446dd0da.jpg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;黄田村野花&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, we visited the Mao Zedong Memorial Museum in Shaoshan, learning about Chairman Mao’s leadership in completing China’s historical tasks against imperialism and feudalism, establishing the People’s Republic of China, and advancing socialism’s glorious history. Afterwards, we visited the great man’s former residence. The environment was excellent, with a half-acre lotus pond in front of the house, giving it a feeling of &amp;ldquo;repeating lakes and overlapping peaks, clear and splendid&amp;rdquo;.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://dongli.pages.dev/file/30b5d6cc284310b6dfd78.jpg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;毛主席故居&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearby, I unexpectedly met two middle school classmates who were also participating in the study tour, now attending another high school. We discussed our studies and lives over the past year and the new changes in our lives as we entered a new stage. Finally, we took a group photo and parted ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner, we watched the large-scale live performance &amp;ldquo;China Gave Birth to Mao Zedong&amp;rdquo; in Shaoshan. We watched from a high platform, enjoying the spacious venue. Opening my map app on my phone, I surprisingly found a satellite image that clearly resembled a map of China. (Taiwan Province and Hainan Province are on the bottom right of the theater.)
&lt;img src=&#34;https://dongli.pages.dev/file/03170402df8a6ce2a87ff-c0a7d1b2bffe126517.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;satellite image&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scene at the event was as shown in the following image. The dazzling lights of the performance were truly awe-inspiring.

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;演出&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed overnight at a hotel in the Huitang town near Changsha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-4-inspiring-our-nation&#34;&gt;Day 4: Inspiring Our Nation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning to Changsha after more than two hours by bus, we visited the First Normal School in the morning, Chairman Mao’s alma mater. In the afternoon, we visited Orange Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange Island sits atop the Xiang River, with a narrow and elongated shape. We took a small train from the north of Orange Island, heading south to the tip of Orange Island. The school planned for the entire grade to take a large group photo on the square at the tip of Orange Island. We arrived early and had spare time to stroll along the shore with classmates. The slow flow of the Xiang River and its wide surface offered a pleasant view of the water flowing south and many boats passing by.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://dongli.pages.dev/file/4f0650ecaaac5f79a4124.jpg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;湘江&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Song Dynasty poet Zhang Xiaoxiang praised:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;濯足夜滩急，晞发北风凉。吴山楚泽行遍，只欠到潇湘。买得扁舟归去，此事天公付我，六月下沧浪。蝉蜕尘埃外，蝶梦水云乡。&lt;br&gt;制荷衣，纫兰佩，把琼芳。湘妃起舞一笑，抚瑟奏清商。唤起九歌忠愤，拂拭三闾文字，还与日争光。莫遣儿辈觉，此乐未渠央。(English translation is shown on the top of the page)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like the meaning in this lyric, a blend of Su Shi’s broad-mindedness and Li Qingzhao’s fresh and elegant style, between a clear and high-minded mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking the group photo, we went to the Mao Zedong Youth Art Statue north of Orange Isle. The sculpture’s eyes were bright, just like Chairman Mao’s &amp;ldquo;We criticized with all our might, pointing to stream and hill, writing in blame or praise (指点江山，激扬文字)&amp;rdquo; demeanor.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://dongli.pages.dev/file/126a152ca347a34270d31.jpg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;雕像&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the evening, we returned near Shaoshan and held a bonfire party. The fireworks at the bonfire party were exciting, breaking the silence of the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align =&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;video src=&#34;https://video.gumlet.io/65b99c6ae5f634aafa2ef6a0/668a43c4517fbad3e8038e27/download.mp4&#34; controls=&#34;controls&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; &gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I can’t sing, I didn’t sign up for the class chorus performance. However, during our class performance, a few of my good friends lifted me onto the stage. This scene was seen by my classmates who work at the TV station, who filmed it as a &amp;ldquo;highlight&amp;rdquo; of the event and aired it on the TV program. Now I’m somewhat famous throughout the school~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-5returning-home&#34;&gt;Day 5：Returning Home
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the morning, we visited the Yuan Longping Rice Museum, and in the afternoon, we took the high-speed train back to Shenzhen by evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dongli.pages.dev/file/fc26ba5b1b84c626256d4.jpg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;速度&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the return train made fewer stops, we arrived at the Shenzhen North Railway Station in three hours. We dispersed near it, concluding our study tour successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study tour, we learned about culture, history, and heritage. Today, in the midst of prosperity and standing in the grand tide of the &amp;ldquo;great changes unseen in a century&amp;rdquo;, we are fortunate to have an unprecedented broad vision, to stand at the pinnacle of history, and to look forward to the distant and brilliant future. The magnificent picture of national rejuvenation slowly unfolds before our eyes, inspiring and urging us forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, as the gatherers of new knowledge, explorers of new thoughts, and the surfers of the new era, we naturally shoulder a heavy and sacred mission. &amp;ldquo;So many deeds cry out to be done, and always urgently; the world rolls on, time presses. (多少事，从来急，天地转，光阴迫)&amp;rdquo; As the future of the nation and the hope of the nation, we deeply understand the weight of responsibility and the honor of the mission. We pledge to use China’s unique wisdom, innovative solutions, and firm actions to outline and shape a better world tomorrow, allowing China’s voice to resonate globally and making the world more splendid because of our young generation!

        <title>Long dreams</title>
        <link>https://brume.top/en/p/long-dreams/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://brume.top/en/p/long-dreams/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://dongli.pages.dev/file/74beaf2497a1c52909704.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Long dreams" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blog has been running smoothly for a year now, and the thought fills me with excitement! Reaching this one-year milestone, I look back at the journey with a flood of emotions and thoughts rushing in like waves. It&amp;rsquo;s a moment filled with reflection, and I pen this to mark the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning this article for a while, and as I drafted it, the title &amp;ldquo;The Long Dream&amp;rdquo; repeatedly came to mind. Life, after all, feels like a dream. I believe it symbolizes my reflections on life and my philosophical quest, while also mirroring the long journey that countless people embark on in pursuit of truth and the meaning of existence.
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://brume.top/p/hello-world/&#34; &gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Spring Trees, Evening Clouds&amp;rdquo; is more than just a blog, it&amp;rsquo;s a sanctuary for my soul. Since the end of 2022, I&amp;rsquo;ve been sharing my explorations and discoveries here with my readers. Through my writing, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that life is like an extended dream. Whether in high school, university, or stepping into society later on, we all build dreams and chase them at different stages. Pausing from time to time allows us to rethink, recalibrate, and help the humble me refocus on future explorations.
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://brume.top/p/long-dreams/&#34; &gt;&lt;em&gt;Long dreams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced both glory and humiliation, seems sometimes basked in spring breezes and sometimes weathered frost and snow. I understand now that life is a long and intricate journey. This is precisely why I hold myself to higher standards, to courageously follow my dreams and fearlessly break free from my cocoon. Don&amp;rsquo;t let uncertainty scare you, because it is uncertainty that awakens our deepest potential.
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://brume.top/p/certainty-and-uncertainty/&#34; &gt;&lt;em&gt;Certainty and Uncertainty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we clear away the fog of life, we&amp;rsquo;ll encounter countless questions and challenges. We will stumble and fall, get hurt, but we will also rise again. This, I believe, is the true essence of life—a great and authentic life requires facing trials and turbulence, for only through such struggles can miracles unfold. I imagine that even us smallest human beings, through writing, can create something grand and magnificent in our lives.
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://brume.top/p/restart/&#34; &gt;&lt;em&gt;Restart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one-year anniversary marks only a new beginning for the blog, but my exploration and reflection are far from over. I will continue to face new challenges, embrace new opportunities, and gather new knowledge and experiences. I hope that after some time, I&amp;rsquo;ll return here with richer insights to share with you all once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to thank every reader of this blog. Your support and encouragement fuel my drive to move forward. Please remember, even though the blog updates may be sporadic, the exploration and reflection of the soul never cease. Let&amp;rsquo;s continue to follow this &amp;ldquo;Long Dream,&amp;rdquo; delving into the deeper philosophies of life. &amp;ldquo;Raise your glass to the east wind, and let&amp;rsquo;s face the future together with ease!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Greetings from the bottom of my heart&lt;br&gt;Zephyr Easton&lt;br&gt;Dec. 31, 2023&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mighty desert is burning for the love of a blade of grass who shakes her head and laughs and flies away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stray Birds&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This afternoon, I was heading home from school. The return trip was packed, and I was sitting side by side with a classmate. When he reached his stop, I leaned aside to let him pass. As he was leaving, he asked me, &amp;ldquo;Are you the student who gave a speech on stage before?&amp;rdquo; I nodded. Due to the success of my previous speech on philosophy, many freshmen knew me, but I couldn’t recall their names. This wasn’t the first time I encountered this situation. After getting off the bus, I walked with a friend, pondering a question in my mind: how did my speeches begin and why were they successful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In middle school, my first formal speech was in May 2022. The success of that speech had an element of chance, but it laid the foundation for my subsequent speeches. Coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the Communist Youth League, my homeroom teacher selected me as the speaker for the flag-raising ceremony. After discussing with teachers, I chose &amp;ldquo;Chasing Dreams in Youth, Striving in the Era&amp;rdquo; as the theme. This speech under the national flag received a warm response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August of the same year, the grade recommended me to speak at the opening ceremony, encouraging classmates to strive for their youth goals. A few days before the school year started, I came to school to prepare and coincidentally met the new grade director. She had heard my previous speech, had confidence in my abilities, and offered some suggestions for improvement for this speech. However, due to the pandemic, the school opening was delayed, and the speech was put on hold. It wasn’t until December 2022, after mid-term exams, that our grade held an online congress. At noon that day, I participated in a video recording in the school’s party member activity room with other relevant students. In the afternoon, my speech shook the grade, with applause and cheers from other classes and gave me a lot of encouragement. Perhaps it was these successes of my speech that led more kindred friends to recognize my abilities and recommend me to continue speaking in this new collective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third speech was more low-profile and took place when the new class was created in February of this year. The class teacher and some students thought that the opening of the class should have a ceremony, so I was nominated to speak with the class president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth speech was the one mentioned at the beginning of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, although my first speech was accidental, it paved the way for a series of speeches afterwards. Many friends think that with my continuous efforts, chance gradually turns into certainty. This also means that when selecting speakers, uncertainty is gradually becoming uniform (Of course, this is just one’s view, and I think that many of my high school classmates are much more competent than me, and they may become the next ones to be nominated. I am clearly aware of this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I complain to my friends that I have to make three public speeches in the last month, which is too tiring; but sometimes I feel very lucky to be trusted and recognized by teachers and friends. A completely certain world is boring; a world full of uncertainty is impermanent and terrifying. I want to ask myself: how do we mediate?&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to think deeply about these two concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty gives us the opportunity to innovate and progress. We live in a world that is always unknown. When the future is filled with unknowns, we no longer rely on past experiences and established patterns. Instead of sticking to traditions, we need to look for new methods, new strategies, and new opportunities. It is in moments of uncertainty that we challenge ourselves, surpass our limits, and embrace new possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my perspective, both certainty and uncertainty provide opportunities for personal growth and development. As mentioned earlier regarding my speeches—in a certain environment, although our inertia can be daunting and we might fall into a comfort zone, lacking motivation for new experiences and challenges… But it is during moments of uncertainty and transformation that we can adapt to new environments and situations more swiftly, much like when we leave our former collective and arrive at a new high school! I dare to predict that this adaptability will indeed make us more independent and resilient, surely helping to enhance our skills in various aspects of our lives!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, by learning from uncertainty and accumulating experiences, we can cultivate better problem-solving abilities. These opportunities for growth can make us more competitive and prepare us for a future that aligns with the ideals of &amp;ldquo;comprehensive development&amp;rdquo; advocated by our Party, nation, and society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, whether it is certainty or uncertainty, the influence and transformation it brings to an individual is an &lt;strong&gt;utterly misleading proposition&lt;/strong&gt;! Every person is a &amp;ldquo;node&amp;rdquo; in the vast web of society, and personal growth is inseparable from social contexts! My ability to be recognized for my speeches isn’t due to certainty; rather, it stems from the effort I’ve put into this endeavor. Extending this thought further, the achievements of our school are not solely determined by &amp;ldquo;certainty&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;uncertainty&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ni Dieu, ni César, ni tribun &lt;br&gt;Producteurs, sauvons-nous nous-mêmes!&lt;p align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;L’Internationale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both certainty and uncertainty can only play a facilitating role in personal growth; the ultimate decision-making power lies within our own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this, I feel that many of my friends around me are, to varying degrees, infatuated with the notions of “certainty” and “uncertainty.” I recall a classmate from another Province earlier this year, who upon hearing inappropriate remarks from a lecturer during a talk, seized the microphone and resolutely proclaimed, &amp;ldquo;We study for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation!&amp;rdquo; I admire this classmate’s grand vision and expansive perspective. We are the youth of a new era in China. It is our significant responsibility to ensure that we, as young people, have poetry and the distant future in our eyes! Studying is not merely about learning a few English words or mathematical symbols; more importantly, it is about cultivating a broad mind and a wide vision! This has nothing to do with one’s gentle or rough character, nor with &amp;ldquo;certainty&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;uncertainty&amp;rdquo;! Among the great figures in modern Chinese history—leaders like Chairman Mao, Qu Qiubai, Chen Duxiu, and General Peng, each had distinct personalities, yet they are all remarkable figures in the glorious history of our nation. &amp;ldquo;In books, there are beautiful faces; in books, there are houses of gold.&amp;rdquo; As one of the top 5% students in Shenzhen(Said by our teachers), how can we have a narrow vision, or even shy away from putting our ideas on the table? Young people should understand from an early age: &amp;ldquo;Read thousands of classic texts and walk a thousand miles of life’s journey!&amp;rdquo; Be resolute in adversity and never lose sight of lofty ambitions! Strive for higher goals, seek broader horizons, and maintain a grounded demeanor! Those who are near excellent people would turn excellent; those who are near bad guys may turn bad! Studying is not about seeking a so called &amp;ldquo;certainty&amp;rdquo; for survival but about cultivating oneself, managing one’s family, governing the nation, and bringing peace to the world! Studying is also about establishing one’s own heart, setting examples for friends, bringing honor to one’s family, working for one’s country, and possessing the ability to foster peace for all!&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this world filled with opportunities and challenges, seizing opportunities is crucial for both individuals and society. How do we gracefully face certainty and uncertainty? How do we seize opportunities and respond to challenges? These are fundamental questions that each of us needs to contemplate.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The exam to test the results of my three years of learning has ended, and I has spent half my day free. Two months after the database was deleted by mistake and all the blog posts were emptied, I logged into the site again. The intent is clear, I&amp;rsquo;m going to start over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;ve been through a lot lately, and when I look at the works I&amp;rsquo;ve written before, I feel that the current me is completely different from the old one. If I compare the text of these two time periods side by side, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll feel a wonderful contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated a lot of things to say, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend my pen and ink on the Internet. My mind is still too divergent to write this article titled &amp;ldquo;Restart&amp;rdquo;. I know that I can&amp;rsquo;t slack off, and I am only willing to take advantage of half a day to rebuild the website, which may be regarded as a witness to my own growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it seems that &amp;ldquo;restart&amp;rdquo; is the beginning of a new journey; It is the beginning of new dreams and new hopes; It is the beginning of a new growth and a new atmosphere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a saying that I particularly like - only those who can control time can control their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am convinced that I will be able to surpass my normal self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to &lt;strong&gt;RESTART&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;春树暮云(Spring trees and evening clouds)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has been successfully created!
&lt;font color=&#34;red&#34;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;why we call the site &lt;em&gt;Spring trees and evening clouds&lt;/em&gt; ?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;ldquo;Spring trees and evening clouds&amp;rdquo; is from a piece of poem written by Du Fu, a well-known Chinese poet. In the past, it means missing friends from afar. Now I think it also means pursue our ideals. Spring trees and evining clouds symbolize our unattainable dreams, hard to achieve but also have hope. It&amp;rsquo;s our duty to achieve it, achieve &amp;ldquo;the spring trees and evening clouds&amp;rdquo;。&lt;/p&gt;
